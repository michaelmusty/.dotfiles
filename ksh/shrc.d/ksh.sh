# If we're running some kind of ksh, we'll need to source its specific

# their own rc files first, which I've written to then look for ~/.shrc; ksh
# does it the other way around.

# Unfortunately, this isn't very simple, because KSH_VERSION is set by PDKSH
# and derivatives, and in ksh93t+ and above, but not in earlier versions of
# ksh93.  To make matters worse, the best way I can find for testing the
# version makes other shells throw tantrums.

# Does the name of our shell have "ksh" in it at all?  This is in no way
# guaranteed.  It's just a heuristic that e.g. Bash shouldn't pass.
