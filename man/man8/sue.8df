.B sue

.SH DESCRIPTION
Run sudoedit(8) over the arguments given as the user that owns them all; exit
with an error if they're not owned by a common user.  This could be useful in
situations where you don't have full root access via sudo(8), or simply want
to be strict about working with least privilege.
