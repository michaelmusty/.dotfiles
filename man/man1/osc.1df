.SH NAME
.B osc
\- netcat-like wrapper for openssl s_client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B osc [HOST [SERVICE]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B osc
runs openssl(1ssl)'s s_client subcommand with some options to make it behave a
bit like netcat(1), quieting errors and even handling STARTTLS if it knows how,
but still forcing correct verification of certificates and only connecting with
TLS (not SSL).
.P
If rlwrap(1) is available, the client will be run within that to allow line
editing.
.P
It's intended to be run as an interactive tool for cases where you want to
focus more on debugging the data exchange with the actual server, and not
debugging the OpenSSL negotiation itself.  The author finds it handy for poking
his STARTTLS SMTP mailserver.
