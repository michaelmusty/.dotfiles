.TH JFP 1df "January 2017" "Manual page for jfp"
.SH NAME
.B jfp
\- print input, excluding any shebang on the first line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jfp
FILE [FILE2 ...]
.br
.B jfp
< FILE
.P
#!/usr/bin/env jfp
.br
All this content will be printed verbatim,
.br
except for the first line,
.br
because it's a shebang.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jfp
prints all the input given to it except for the first line if it starts with a
shebang "#!".  This means it can be used in a shebang to simply echo the entire
remaining contents of the script.
.SH NOTES
Can you guess what it stands for?
.P
A portable way to do the same thing could be using a heredoc with cat(1):
.P
    #!/bin/sh
    cat <<'EOD'
    All this content will be printed verbatim...
    ...except for the first line...
    ...because it's a shebang.
    EOD
.P
The only snag there is having to check the token word doesn't appear in the
document.
