.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clog
receives a message on stdin or from the file arguments, timestamps it with a
leading date(1), and writes it to the file with path in environment variable
CLOG, defaulting to ~/.clog, terminating each entry with two hyphens.
.P
If there are no files to read and standard input is coming from a terminal, and
rlwrap(1) is found, it will be used for the line editing.  If not, just the
terminal's cooked mode will be used.
