.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dub
lists the biggest entries in a given directory, defaulting to the current
directory.  It defaults to printing 10 entries unless a second argument is
given.
.SH CAVEATS
Skips filenames with newlines in them with an explicit warning to stderr, for
the least dangerous POSIX-compatible approach.  Even so, you probably shouldn't
use this in critical scripts.
