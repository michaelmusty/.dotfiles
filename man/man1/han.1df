.SH NAME
.B han
\- try running builtin help, then man(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B han
.I (HELPTOPIC | MANARGS...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
If called with a single argument, try running the help builtin for the given
keyword, writing its output to a file.  If it succeeds, show that.  If not,
pass the call to man(1).
.P
This was written so it could be used as a 'keywordprg' in Vim for Bash files;
you can then use the K normal-mode binding over both shell builtins (e.g. read,
set, export) and external programs (e.g. cat(1), grep(1), ed(1)).
