.SH NAME
.B gms
\- run getmail(1) requests in parallel over multiple getmailrc.* files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gms
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gms
runs getmail(1) for each file matching the pattern ~/.getmail/getmailrc.*,
doing much the same thing as the getmails(1) script included in the Getmail
distribution.  It differs from that script in a few ways:
.IP \[bu] 4
It includes per-rc-file locking so that at most one getmail(1) process runs for
the same account, but allows multiple instances of gms(1df) to run at the same
time.
.IP \[bu]
It runs the requests in parallel using fork(2)/wait(2).
.IP \[bu]
It uses try(1df) to attempt each fetch three times, with 15 seconds between each
attempt, and only prints errors if all three attempts fail.
.SH SEE ALSO
getmail(1), try(1df)
