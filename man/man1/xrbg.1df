.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xrbg
searches for images in the directory named in the XBACKGROUNDS environment
variable (defaults to ~/.xbackgrounds), chooses a random one with rndf(1df),
and applies it with feh(1).  It's designed for use in ~/.xinitrc, but it seems
to work when called manually from within an X session too.
