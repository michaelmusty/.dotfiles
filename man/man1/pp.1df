.SH NAME
.B pp
\- print the full path to each argument
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pp
/arg arg2 ./arg3
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pp
uses $PWD to print the full path to each of its arguments, unless they begin
with a slash, in which case they are printed verbatim.
.P
The path need not actually exist.
.SH CAVEATS
Newlines in filenames will still work, but the results won't really make sense
as they'll be indistinguishable from newlines separating the files.  This is
for generating human-readable file lists, not for machines.
