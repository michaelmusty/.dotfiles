.SH NAME
.B rnds
\- try to get a random seed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rnds
.br
.B rnds
1024
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rnds
uses POSIX tools to try and find a random number device on the system and emits
the first field of a cksum(1) based on it as a low-quality random numeric seed.
The only optional argument allows specifying the number of random bytes to
read, defaulting to 32.  This is intended as a low-quality seed for rndi(1df).
.P
/dev/urandom is tried first, then /dev/arandom, then /dev/random, before the
script gives up and emits nothing.
.P
If you have OpenSSL, you will almost certainly prefer rand(1ssl).
