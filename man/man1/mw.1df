.B mw
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mw
separates the input into space-delimited words and prints them one per line,
with no deduplication or sorting.  It's a fairly na√Øve approach to the problem
but it works fine as a crude initial approach.
.SH NOTES
This was written after watching that lovely old AT&T video where members of the
Unix team (specifically Brian Kernighan and Lorinda Cherry) demonstrate piping
programs together; Kernighan demonstrates `makewords` during his example.
