.SH NAME
.B swr
\- run a command including remote file arguments for scp(1) reading
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B swr
cat remote:.ssh/authorized_keys
.br
.B swr
diff .shrc remote:.shrc
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B swr
runs the command given in its arguments, first replacing any arguments in the
form HOST:PATH with copies of the specified files as retrieved with scp(1),
copied into a temporary directory that should be removed on exit under most
circumstances.
.P
This even works for the first argument (i.e. the command), provided that it
will run on the local system once copied in.
.SH CAVEATS
You can't write to remote files with it.  The arguments only work as input
streams, so e.g. "cp .vimrc remote:.vimrc" won't do what you expect.
.P
This only works for simple commands; you can't put shell syntax into any of the
arguments.
.P
The whole script will stop if even one of its arguments can't be copied in, as
there's no way to tell whether it's safe to proceed without some of the data.
.P
Don't even think about using this for mission-critical cases or situations
requiring high security.  It's a convenience wrapper.
.P
You may not need this at all if your shell has working command substitution and
you find its syntax clearer:
.P
    diff .shrc <(ssh remote 'cat .shrc')
