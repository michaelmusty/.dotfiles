.B trs
STRING REPLACEMENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B trs
replaces the string given in its first argument with the string given in its
second, with no regex metacharacters, in a way that should work on all POSIX
implementations.  It is thereby the string complement for tr(1).
.P
The first argument cannot be a null string.  The second argument can be blank
(but must still be specified) to implicitly delete all occurrences of the
string.
.SH CAVEATS
It can't replace newlines.
