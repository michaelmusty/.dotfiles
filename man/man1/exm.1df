.SH NAME
.B exm
\- invoke Vim's ex(1) with a dumb terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exm
[EX_OPTIONS...] [FILES]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B exm
works around a quirk of Vim that causes it to clear the screen when invoked as
ex(1) interactively. It applies Vim's -T option to force the terminal to the
builtin "dumb" terminal.
.SH CAVEATS
This breaks switching to visual mode with :visual completely, as the terminal
will persist in its dumb state. I'm not sure there's a way to fix this. If
there were a Vim :autocmd for mode switching, it might be possible, or perhaps
by wrapping :visual somehow to :set terminal=$TERM before the switch.
