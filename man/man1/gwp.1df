.SH NAME
.B gwp
\- wordwise (alphanumeric) grep(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gwp WORD [FILE...]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gwp
searches for complete alphanumeric words (not regular expressions) in the input and
prints the line if found.  This means you can search for "test" and it won't
print lines just because they contain "latest".  It's good for searching prose
or poetry rather than code.
.P
This is intended as a workaround for the absence of a portable implementation
of "word boundaries" in POSIX.  Instead, this awk(1) script breaks each line
down into alphanumeric words and tests each one for case-insensitive equality.
.P
It does not emulate all of grep(1)'s features by any means, but does include
the feature of prefixing a matched line with the filename if more than one
filename was searched.
