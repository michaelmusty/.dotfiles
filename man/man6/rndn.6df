.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rndn
uses an advanced but somewhat esoteric algorithm derived by Adams (2001) to
return a random number.  The seed can be derived internally or specified as an
argument.
.P
While rndn(6df) has proven robust in the author's production usage, its
algorithm has not been formally verified.
