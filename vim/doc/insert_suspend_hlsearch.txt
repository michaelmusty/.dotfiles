*insert_suspend_hlsearch.txt*	For Vim version 7.0	Last change: 2017 November 12

DESCRIPTION					*insert_suspend_hlsearch*

This plugin quietly disables 'hlsearch' search highlighting if enabled when an
insert operation is started, and puts it back once done, to avoid the
distracting effect the highlighting can cause while writing.

REQUIREMENTS					*insert_suspend_hlsearch-requirements*

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

AUTHOR						*insert_suspend_hlsearch-author*

Written and maintained by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>.

LICENSE						*insert_suspend_hlsearch-license*

Licensed for distribution under the same terms as Vim itself (see |license|).

DISTRIBUTION					*insert_suspend_hlsearch-distribution*

This plugin lives in Tom Ryder's "dotfiles" suite, and may eventually be spun
off into a separate distribution as it solidifies and this documentation
improves. See <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/dotfiles.git/about/> for more
information.
