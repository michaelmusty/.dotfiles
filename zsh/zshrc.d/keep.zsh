#
# keep -- Main function for zshkeep; provided with a list of NAMEs, whether
# shell functions or variables, writes the current definition of each NAME to a
# directory $ZSHKEEP (defaults to ~/.zshkeep.d) with a .zsh suffix, each of
# which is reloaded each time this file is called. This allows you to quickly
# arrange to keep that useful shell function or variable you made inline on
# subsequent logins.
#
# Consider a shell function declared inline with the NAME 'ayy':
#
#   $ ayy() { printf '%s\n' lmao ; }
#   $ ayy
#   lmao
#   $ keep ayy
#   $ keep
#   ayy
#   $ exit
#
# Then, on next login, the function is redefined for you:
#
#   $ ayy
#   lmao
#
# To get rid of it:
#
#   $ keep -d ayy
#
